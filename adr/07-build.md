# Build

## Status

Implemented (Issue with buildkit after updating new docker version)

## Context

For the development process, an appropriate procedure that enables participation should be created.

## Decision

We will use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to easely pack and run our application.

## Consequences

Docker enables developers to package applications into containers, this will help other developers to easely setup the application and participate in the developement. Also Docker containers are easy to deploy in a cloud.
